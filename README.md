What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Using standard c++ libraries to read file data and build behavior around it. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
White boarding and laying down a structure for how you approach a problem then using c++ algo / data structures to solve problems.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
C++ can be hard, but since there wasn't a lot of memory management not too many blockers.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Having strong fundamentals will help you approach larger problems in future software development.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Coming back to c / c++ is always good for all developers. These days, especially in web development, the low level aspect of programming
is abstracted out. It is always good to come back and get a feel for low level management.
